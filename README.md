## Quickstart

When you're working on your project immediately after having it in your
local repo, move to the root of the app.

1. Install node compontents `npm install` 
2. Install bower components `bower install`

#### CSS vs SCSS
You should write your stylesheets in SCSS and use compass to preprocess it to
app.css ( do not edit app.css manually)

Use compass watch for precompiling 
```bash
bundle exec compass watch
```

Use the node server by running `node server.js` which will start your server in
port 8000
